    <p contenteditable>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
