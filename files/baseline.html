    <h2>Star Wars - H2</h2>
    <p contenteditable>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

      <h5>Monty Python - H5</h5>
      <p>A newt? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Oh, ow!</p>
